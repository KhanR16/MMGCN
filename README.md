# MMGCN
Cold-start users have always been a daunting task to deal with in the paradigm of recommender systems. The presence of these cold-start users in multiple domains has addressed the problem of their sparse presence in the target domain. The interactions of cold-start users in the source domain predicts their interests in target domain. The interactions of cold-start users in the source
domain plays a pivotal role in predicting their interests in target domain. The question of paramount importance remains what to transfer and the manner to achieve it. Most recent advancements in this
area mitigate the gap of two domains by using tags as a bridge to transfer knowledge. We propose a novel framework named Metadata based Multi-Behaviour Graph Convolutional Network for Crossdomain Recommendation (MMGCN) which uses the feedback and interaction information of users and items to devise a neighbourhood based on similarity of preferences they make.
